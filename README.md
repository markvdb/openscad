# openscad

Some miscelaneous openscad fiddlings:

* europallet.scad (obviously) is an OpenSCAD modelled Euro pallet.
* boxbed.scad is a basic bed built out of four identical small cupboards, inspired by http://www.instructables.com/id/Box-Bed by Wholman of http://www.objectguerilla.com/ .

Feel free to play with these! Bug reports and improvements welcome!
